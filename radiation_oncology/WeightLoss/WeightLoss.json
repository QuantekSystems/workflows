	"description": "This workflow is intended to automatically evaluate weight loss of a patient when a new weight observation is created in a health information system. A decision table is executed to evaluate the weight loss level, low, medium, or high. If the weight loss is high, a new CT scan order is created. The workflow waits for the CT scan to be complete, and then a decision to be made by the physician whether to replan the treatment. If the decision is yes, a notification is sent to replan the treatment."
